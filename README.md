The Solidity code implements the core ERC20 standard functionality. 


## About GreenMed
### What is GreenMed?
GreenMed is the world's first ERC-20 Ethereum token backed application enabling customers to purchase legal marijuana using their debit or credit cards.

GreenMed lets legal marijuana dispensaries accept debit or credit card payments via the use of cutting edge electronic payment processing technology in conjunction with the Ethereum blockchain.

Over the past several years we have been looking for countless ways for our dispensaries to accept electronic payments. However due to strict federal regulations banks are unable to partner with legal marijuana dispensaries.

This leaves cryptocurrency and Ethereum as the only option to help this $5 Billion industry accept mainstream electronic payments such as credit cards and EFT's.

Our application will be a one stop shop for both the consumer of legal marijuana and the dispensaries. Users will be able to pay using a debit or credit card, and even pre-purchase for pick-up, all within the app, while having the option to pay with a convenient online digital currency.

The optional GreenMed debit card allows the merchant to withdraw the funds directly from any ATM in the Visa network and even use it for purchases.

### What is the GreenMed Token?
The GreenMed token facilitates debit and credit card transactions between customers and dispensaries.
When customers attempt to purchase legal marijuana through the GreenMed app they will be asked to
input either their credit card information or their banking information. Customers will then need to
authorize a transaction for an amount of GreenMed tokens equal to the current USD value of legal
marijuana they are trying to purchase. The GreenMed token is then sold on exchanges for USD, which
is then transferred to the merchantâ€™s GreenMed account. The merchant can withdraw via an EFT to a
bank account or using the GreenMed debit card.
